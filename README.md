# Object-declarations-Cell
You have a class Cell with a nested object BaseProperties. This nested object contains two properties height and width. However, the dimensions of a cell may be different from the default ones, so you need to create its own height and width with the default values from the singleton BaseProperties.

Do not copy and paste values!
